# Activity-Recognition-using-Keras

This is my recent work based on Activity Recognition. It was driven by my motive of extending a machine the human ability to recognise surrounding activities. 
This idea was primarily inspired by my project on Object Detection that I had developed in my internship, and I wanted to enhance it for a more significant application.

Firstly, clone the dataset from Anubhav Maityâ€™s repo: https://github.com/anubhavmaity/Sports-Type-Classifier into the project directory.

Create two empty directories and name them model and output.

Run train.py to train the model.

Run predict_video.py to predict the actions from the videos in example_clips directory.
